# suns map

a map that develops over time and generations of entrypoints. can also be subjected to sacrifices.

## factors

- location of entrypoint
- state of entrypoint
- generation
- connection between entrypoints (additional layer)

## notes

- vector map
    - district
        - 3d surface
        - heightmap
        - topography lines shader
        - move all vertices in a given area to smooth slope
    - path
        - find clusters, modulate ofPath between two
        - branch away from path
    - edge
        - limit of zone of influence of each entrypoint?
    - node
        - entrypoints, could have specific addition to it (texture?)
    - landmark
        - tbd but needed (lake?)
        - squares as houses
- file input/output
- http server
